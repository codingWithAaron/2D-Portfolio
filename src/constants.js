  projects: `Info about this portfolio : It's made with the Kaboom.js library which is a library for making games in JavaScript.
  Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. I followed a tutorial by Beau Carnes on how to do this, which was from freecodecamp.org, and made modifications to make it my own! Credit for the sprites and tilesets goes to PixiVan on itch.io and a few from the tutorial itself.`,
  chest: `Contained within this chest are a couple of my favorite books. I'm not much of a recreational reader, but I LOVE the Empyrean series by Rebecca Yarros. There's only two books currently out, Fourth Wing and Iron Flame, but the third has been announced and I absolutely cannot wait!`
